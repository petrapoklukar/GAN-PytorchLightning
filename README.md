# Pytorch Ligtning Implementation of GAN and contrastiveGAN
This repostory includes a simple implementation of a GAN model using Pytorch Ligtning. It also expands it with an experimental implementation of a contrastiveGAN model similar to the idea presented in [Training GANs with Stronger Augmentations via Contrastive Discriminator](https://openreview.net/forum?id=eo6U4CAwVmg).
